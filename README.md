202attempt2 is an example of dynamic programming, more information can be found in the pdf in the src folder

prototypeDesign1 and py files are examples of code produced as part of my dissertation for web scraping.
More information about the design of the program and database used can be found in the WebScrapeInfo pdf
  more specifically section 5
  
Note that, even if the database is recreated, the web scraping system will not work.
More information can be found in WebScrapeInfo.pdf, but the gist of it is that the website completely changed a week before the project

IMPORTANT

Do not attempt to run the web scraping system, it will not work, see WebScrapeInfo.pdf
